# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Primary Development Areas
1. **Memory Bank Setup**: Establishing comprehensive documentation system for project continuity
2. **Custom Instructions**: Creating tailored Cline instructions for project-specific patterns
3. **Knowledge Capture**: Documenting existing implementation patterns and decisions

### Recent Changes
- **Added .clinerules**: Implemented memory bank workflow and documentation standards
- **Created Memory Bank Structure**: Established core documentation files with project context
- **Enhanced Instructions**: Comprehensive custom instructions for project-specific development

### Active Decisions & Considerations

#### Memory Bank Architecture
- **Decision**: Implement structured memory bank with hierarchical file organization
- **Rationale**: Ensures project continuity across Cline memory resets
- **Implementation**: Core files (projectbrief, productContext, systemPatterns, techContext, activeContext, progress)

#### Documentation Strategy
- **Decision**: Maintain both custom instructions and memory bank
- **Rationale**: Instructions guide development patterns, memory bank captures project evolution
- **Balance**: Instructions for "how to work", memory bank for "what has been done"

#### Project Context Capture
- **Decision**: Comprehensive documentation of existing codebase patterns
- **Rationale**: Enables consistent development and extension of existing patterns
- **Focus**: Architecture decisions, coding conventions, and domain knowledge

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish creating `progress.md` file
2. **Validate Documentation**: Ensure all memory bank files are complete and accurate
3. **Test Workflow**: Verify that documentation supports effective development workflow

### Short Term (Next Few Sessions)
1. **TraceQL Implementation**: Begin work on TraceQL parsing and integration
2. **Project Operations**: Implement project/select operations for query pipeline
3. **Enhanced Testing**: Add more comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize AST construction performance
2. **Error Handling**: Enhance error reporting and user feedback
3. **Documentation**: Create user-facing documentation and examples

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Development Workflow
- **Memory Bank First**: Always read and update memory bank before making changes
- **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementing new features
- **Documentation**: Update both code comments and memory bank documentation
- **Incremental**: Make small, well-tested changes rather than large refactors

### Code Quality Standards
- **Nullable Reference Types**: Consistently use nullable annotations
- **XML Documentation**: All public members must have comprehensive documentation
- **Builder Pattern**: Use AstBuilder for all AST node creation
- **Visitor Pattern**: Implement transformations using visitor pattern

### Testing Approach
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all public methods and edge cases
- **Realistic Examples**: Use actual query examples from KQL and TraceQL
- **Error Conditions**: Test error handling and validation
- **Integration Tests**: Verify end-to-end functionality

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Architecture Insights
- **Unified AST Benefits**: Single AST structure simplifies cross-language analysis
- **Dual Filtering Power**: Trace/span filtering architecture handles complex TraceQL scenarios
- **Builder Pattern Success**: Factory methods provide consistent and validated node creation
- **Visitor Pattern Flexibility**: Easy to add new transformations without modifying AST nodes

### Technical Insights
- **Microsoft Parser Integration**: Leveraging official KQL parser provides robust parsing with minimal effort
- **Graphviz Visualization**: Visual AST representations are crucial for debugging and understanding
- **Test Organization**: Functional grouping of tests makes codebase more maintainable
- **Memory Bank Value**: Structured documentation prevents knowledge loss across sessions

### Domain Knowledge Gained
- **KQL Complexity**: KQL has rich syntax that requires careful AST mapping
- **TraceQL Semantics**: Distributed tracing queries have unique filtering requirements
- **Multi-Query Patterns**: $$ separator with [] span filters creates complex parsing scenarios
- **Cross-Language Challenges**: Unifying different query languages requires careful semantic mapping

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Core Features
- **AST Structure**: Complete node hierarchy with all major types
- **KQL Integration**: Full parsing and conversion from KQL to Common AST
- **Multi-Query Support**: Parsing queries with $$ separators and [] span filters
- **Graphviz Generation**: Visual output for both original and Common AST
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100+ test cases covering all major scenarios

### Recently Completed Work
- **TraceQL Parser Implementation**: Complete TypeScript implementation with text and SVG visualization
- **Parse Tree Visualization**: Enhanced text-based output with proper box-drawing characters
- **SVG Generation**: Professional Graphviz-based visualization for documentation
- **CommonAST Integration**: Fixed and tested TraceQL to CommonAST conversion
- **Box-Drawing Character Fix**: Corrected alignment issues in text-based tree visualization

### Active Development Areas
- **Memory Bank Updates**: Documenting completed TraceQL parser implementation
- **Documentation Enhancement**: Updating memory bank with latest achievements
- **Knowledge Consolidation**: Capturing lessons learned from visualization implementation

### Upcoming Work
- **Project Operations**: Extend query pipeline with project/select operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and improve AST construction performance
- **Integration Planning**: Plan integration of TraceQL parser with main C# project

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Unified AST**: Single structure for all query languages
2. **Dual Filtering**: Separate trace-level and span-level filtering
3. **Builder Pattern**: Factory methods for consistent node creation
4. **Visitor Pattern**: Transformation logic separate from AST structure

### Technical Decisions
1. **Microsoft Parser**: Use official KQL parser for reliability
2. **Graphviz Output**: Visual representation for debugging and understanding
3. **MSTest Framework**: Standard Microsoft testing framework
4. **Nullable Types**: Compile-time null safety throughout codebase

### Quality Decisions
1. **XML Documentation**: Required for all public members
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all scenarios including edge cases
3. **Example-Driven**: Use realistic query examples in tests
4. **Memory Bank**: Structured documentation for project continuity

## Communication Preferences

### Documentation Style
- **Comprehensive**: Detailed explanations with context and rationale
- **Structured**: Clear headings, bullet points, and logical organization
- **Code Examples**: Concrete examples to illustrate concepts
- **Evolution Tracking**: Document how decisions and patterns have evolved

### Development Approach
- **Incremental**: Small, well-tested changes with clear commit messages
- **Collaborative**: Clear communication about changes and decisions
- **Quality-Focused**: Emphasis on maintainable, well-documented code
- **Pattern-Consistent**: Follow established patterns and conventions

### Problem-Solving Style
- **Analysis First**: Understand the problem thoroughly before implementing
- **Multiple Solutions**: Consider different approaches and trade-offs
- **Test-Driven**: Validate solutions with comprehensive tests
- **Documentation**: Capture decisions and rationale for future reference

This active context should be updated regularly to reflect current work, decisions, and insights as the project evolves.
