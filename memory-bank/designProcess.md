# Design Process and Collaboration Patterns

## How We Designed ProjectNode Together

### üìã **Initial Request and Context Gathering**
The user requested implementation of a ProjectNode to map KQL's `project` operator to TraceQL's `select` operation. Before jumping into implementation, we followed a structured discovery process:

1. **Grammar Analysis**: We examined both KQL and TraceQL grammar files to understand the exact syntax patterns
2. **Requirements Clarification**: Discussed scope, type system needs, and engine compatibility
3. **Design Questions**: Challenged assumptions about wildcards, type requirements, and validation responsibilities

### ü§î **Key Design Questions We Explored**

#### Question 1: "Should we support wildcard projections (`*`)?"
**Decision**: No wildcard support for Level 1
**Reasoning**: If all fields are needed, the project operation should be omitted entirely
**Impact**: Simplified design, clearer semantics

#### Question 2: "Do we need type information for all projections?"
**Initial Assumption**: All projections need type info for Expression Evaluation engine
**Challenge**: "Why does project operation require a result type? It doesn't evaluate anything..."
**Refined Decision**: Type info only for transformative operations (calculations, function calls)
**Impact**: Much cleaner API, reduced complexity for simple field selections

#### Question 3: "What level of expression complexity should we support?"
**Decision**: Level 1 (simple fields, aliases, basic arithmetic, simple functions) now, Level 2 (complex expressions) later
**Reasoning**: Start with common use cases, document future TODOs clearly
**Impact**: Focused implementation, clear expansion path

#### Question 4: "Where should validation happen?"
**Decision**: AST contains all info needed, validation happens in downstream phases
**Reasoning**: Separation of concerns, AST focused on representation not validation
**Impact**: Clean architecture, flexible validation strategies

### üîÑ **Iterative Design Refinement**

#### Round 1: Initial Structure
```csharp
// Initial design - too rigid
public class ProjectNode : OperationNode
{
    public List<string> Fields { get; set; }  // Too simple
    public Dictionary<string, string> Aliases { get; set; }  // Separate aliases
}
```

#### Round 2: Expression-Based Design
```csharp
// Improved - but still had issues
public class ProjectionExpression : ASTNode
{
    public Expression Expression { get; set; }
    public string? Alias { get; set; }
    public ExpressionType ResultType { get; set; }  // Always required - wrong!
}
```

#### Round 3: Final Smart Design
```csharp
// Final design - smart about when type info is needed
public class ProjectionExpression : ASTNode
{
    public required Expression Expression { get; set; }
    public string? Alias { get; set; }
    public ExpressionType? ResultType { get; set; }  // Optional - only for transformations
}
```

### üéØ **Design Patterns We Established**

#### Pattern 1: Grammar-Driven Design
- Always start by analyzing the actual grammar files
- Understand the syntax before designing the AST representation
- Map language constructs directly to AST nodes

#### Pattern 2: Progressive Complexity
- Implement Level 1 features first (common cases)
- Document Level 2 features as TODOs with clear comments
- Show examples of future complexity in code comments

#### Pattern 3: Smart Type System
- Don't over-engineer simple cases
- Type information only where actually needed
- Let downstream systems infer types when possible

#### Pattern 4: Cross-Language Compatibility
- Use keywords to distinguish language-specific syntax
- Design AST nodes to represent concepts, not syntax
- Enable round-trip generation to different languages

### üí° **Critical Design Insights**

#### Insight 1: "Type Information Isn't Always Needed"
The breakthrough moment was realizing that simple field selections (`name`, `duration`) don't need type information because the Expression Evaluation engine can infer types from the data schema. Type info is only needed for transformations.

#### Insight 2: "AST Should Represent Intent, Not Syntax"
Rather than literally translating syntax, we designed the AST to represent the semantic intent: "project these expressions with these optional aliases and types."

#### Insight 3: "Future-Proofing Through Documentation"
By clearly documenting Level 2 TODOs in comments, we make it easy for future developers to understand the expansion path without over-engineering the current implementation.

## Collaborative Decision-Making Process

### ü§ù **How We Made Design Decisions**

1. **Question Everything**: Started with "why does this need...?"
2. **Analyze Examples**: Looked at real KQL and TraceQL query patterns
3. **Challenge Assumptions**: "Is this really needed for all cases?"
4. **Iterate Quickly**: Made changes based on new insights
5. **Document Decisions**: Captured reasoning for future reference

### üìù **Documentation Strategy**

#### In-Code Documentation
- Comments explaining Level 1 vs Level 2 support
- Examples showing usage patterns
- Clear reasoning for design choices

#### Memory Bank Updates
- Progress tracking with implementation status
- Design process documentation (this file)
- Patterns for future implementations

### üîç **Questions to Ask for Future Designs**

When designing new AST constructs, always ask:

1. **Grammar Analysis**
   - What does the actual grammar say?
   - How do both languages express this concept?
   - What are the edge cases in the syntax?

2. **Type System**
   - Is type information actually needed here?
   - Can downstream systems infer this information?
   - What are the performance implications?

3. **Expression Complexity**
   - What's the minimum viable implementation?
   - How will we handle complex cases later?
   - Where should we document future TODOs?

4. **Engine Compatibility**
   - Is this design engine-agnostic?
   - Does it work with Arrow data operations?
   - Are we avoiding engine-specific dependencies?

5. **Validation Strategy**
   - Where should validation happen?
   - What information does the AST need to provide?
   - How do we separate concerns cleanly?

## Recommendations for Future Collaborations

### üéØ **For Users**
When requesting new features:
- **Challenge the AI**: Ask "why do we need this?" and "what are the alternatives?"
- **Provide Examples**: Show real-world usage patterns you want to support
- **Ask Questions**: Request explanations of design choices and trade-offs
- **Iterate**: Be willing to refine requirements based on technical insights

### ü§ñ **For AI Assistants**
When implementing new features:
- **Start with Grammar**: Always analyze the actual language grammars first
- **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Don't assume requirements, ask for details
- **Propose Options**: Present multiple design approaches with trade-offs
- **Document Decisions**: Capture the reasoning behind design choices
- **Plan for Growth**: Design Level 1 with clear path to Level 2

### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Principles**
- **Grammar-Driven**: Let language specifications guide AST design
- **Engine-Agnostic**: Avoid dependencies on specific execution engines
- **Type-Conscious**: Be smart about when type information is needed
- **Progressive**: Implement common cases first, document complex cases as TODOs
- **Collaborative**: Use questions and challenges to improve design quality

This collaborative approach resulted in a much better ProjectNode design than either human or AI could have achieved alone. The key was the iterative questioning and refinement process that led to genuine insights about type systems and AST design.
