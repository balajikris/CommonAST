# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The distributed tracing and log analytics ecosystem uses multiple query languages (KQL, TraceQL) that serve similar purposes but have different syntax and semantics. This creates several challenges:

1. **Language Fragmentation**: Developers must learn multiple query languages
2. **Tool Duplication**: Analysis tools must implement separate parsers for each language
3. **Cross-System Analysis**: Difficult to analyze queries across different systems
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Query logic cannot be easily transferred between systems

### Market Context
- **Distributed Tracing Growth**: Increased adoption of microservices drives need for tracing
- **Multi-Cloud Environments**: Organizations use multiple observability platforms
- **Query Complexity**: Growing need for sophisticated analysis across trace data
- **Developer Productivity**: Need for unified tooling and analysis capabilities

## Problems This Project Solves

### For Developers
- **Unified Understanding**: Single AST representation for multiple query languages
- **Cross-Language Analysis**: Analyze patterns across KQL and TraceQL queries
- **Learning Transfer**: Understand similarities and differences between languages
- **Tool Building**: Common foundation for building analysis tools

### For Organizations
- **Standardization**: Common representation for query analysis and governance
- **Migration Support**: Easier to migrate between different observability platforms
- **Training Efficiency**: Reduced complexity when working with multiple systems
- **Tool Consolidation**: Build tools that work across multiple query languages

### For Tool Builders
- **Reduced Complexity**: Single AST instead of multiple parsers
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add support for new query languages
- **Visualization**: Common visualization for different query types
- **Analysis Framework**: Foundation for building query analysis tools

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **Input**: User provides a query (KQL or TraceQL) via CLI
2. **Processing**: System parses query and converts to Common AST
3. **Output**: Generates visualizations and provides AST representation
4. **Analysis**: User can analyze structure, patterns, and relationships

### Key Capabilities
- **Multi-Format Input**: Accept queries in KQL or TraceQL format
- **Unified Processing**: Convert all queries to same AST structure
- **Visual Output**: Generate Graphviz visualizations for understanding
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new query language support

### Usage Patterns
- **Single Query Analysis**: Process individual queries for understanding
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple queries for pattern analysis
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare queries across different languages
- **Educational Use**: Learn query structure and patterns

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity
- **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line usage without complex setup
- **Clear Output**: Understandable visualizations and error messages
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Easy to install and run

### Reliability
